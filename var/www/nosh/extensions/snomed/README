Instructions for including SNOMED CT databases into NOSH ChartingSystem
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Because SNOMED-CT is licensed, it cannot be automatically bundled into the NOSH installation package.

2.  Go to http://www.ihtsdo.org/licensing/ to determine if you live/practice in a country that is a member of IHTSDO.
If so, you can download a free .zip file of the SNOMED data from your respective country.  If not, contact IHTSDO for
further instructions on how to obtain the SNOMED data.

3.  For the United States, go to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html to download the
data.  You'll need to register to the UMLS website (if you're not already registered) to be able to download the file.
This may take up to 3 business days.  This is a HUGE file.   Jot down the last 8 digits of the zip file as this will be 
your date that you'll enter in the install script for step 5.

4.  Unzip the file and place the contents of the directory RF2Release (in the zip file) to the
/var/www/nosh/extensions/snomed directory of your Ubuntu server where NOSH is installed.

5.  Type in sudo bash /var/www/nosh/extensions/snomed/snomed_install.sh and follow the prompts.

6.  Log in to NOSH as admin.  Go to Setup->Extensions->SNOMED-CT and enable the extension!
